!Badkada TGC 1.6.4 info!

First and foremost, thank you for commissioning me I had lots of fun working on this project with you! 

|Controls|

-Swipe on cards to scroll

-Tap once to focus a card, tap it again to use it

-Tap twice within a second to select, do the same to unselect

|Important to note|

Every card *should* work just fine on use without any special instruction with the exception of the Deception and Counter cards. Some cards' processes have been automated for the sake of simplicity, such as the Intimidate card automatically picking a card from your opponents hand, and the Anticipate card automatically rolling the die to see if your opponents last move would be ignored or not.

- To use the Deception card, the skill card you want to mimic must be selected first, then use the Deception card and select the power level, then the Deception card with transform into a copy of the card you had selected.

- To use the Counter card, simply use it as usual and then use the cards you want according to the rules laid out in the Canva, everything should work out properly.

|As with every game development project, there will inevitably be bugs that arise that somehow got missed during testing, feel free to reach out about any possible bugs or exploits.|
